# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the pastry:
- 100g chilled butter (plus extra for greasing)
- 200g plain flour
- 1 medium egg (separated)
- 1 tbsp golden caster sugar

### For the filling:
- 4 sliced bananas
- 394g caramel or dulce de leche
- 300ml double cream
- Dark chocolate (optional, for garnish)

## Method

1. Make the pastry case: Put the butter and flour in a food processor and pulse until it resembles fresh breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and sugar and pulse again until mixed. Add very cold water a tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each addition, until dough starts to come together.
2. Remove dough and knead gently to form a smooth ball. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.
3. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 4. Grease a 23cm loose bottom tart tin. Roll out the pastry and line the tin, leaving about 0.5cm over the edge, trimming with scissors.
4. Line the base with baking parchment and baking beans or rice. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove parchment and beans, brush with beaten egg white, and bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden and crisp. Cool completely.
5. Spread half the caramel on the pastry case, layer bananas on top, cover with remaining caramel. Chill.
6. Whip cream until thick and spoon over the tart. Grate dark chocolate over the top to garnish.
